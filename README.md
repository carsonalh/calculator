# Four-Function Calculator Application

Have you ever been in the middle of buying furniture, needing to make some quick calculations, only
to open your phone and be frustrated by the stock calculator app's efficiency?  Do you miss the
traditional layout, function and speed of those provocatively simple four-function,
number-crunching, solar-powered, liquid-crystal pocket machines?  Probably not -- but I do.  Now,
already wanting to try my hand in app development, and not wanting to carry around a second
phone-sized computer in my pocket, I made this application.

## Design and Implementation

How did I figure out how this thing should function? Link to the article.

Knowing how it should function, what is the model I used to implement it?

What are some of the considerations made to implement it?

## How well does it work?

You can see the application fully deployed on the Google Play Store
[here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.carsonholloway.calculator).

I actually now prefer to use this than my phone's default app (Google Calculator), so I'll call it a
success.

## Project Summary

What did I learn by implementing this, and where could it go in the future?
I learned how to make android apps, which taught me a different way of modelling user interfaces
than HTML/CSS.

What could be done in the future to make it better?
Sideways mode, or some more scientific functions like logs.
